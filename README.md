# BlindTestApp by Tenrom35

This app makes hear song free and without any ads. My site communicates with the Youtube Data Api V3. The user can connect itself with google. You must know that the app was not validate by google so a warning message appear each time you connect.

In the site you can:
- Hear your private yt playlists, videos and shorts.
- Hear all the public yt playlists, videos and shorts. The audio musn't be unlisted.
- You can hear songs without ads. And also in background during one song if you click play on the popup after quit the site. I am limited by yt so I can't makes the app pass to the next song after the end of the current one when the site wasn't open. Likewise I can't automatise the way to play in background.
